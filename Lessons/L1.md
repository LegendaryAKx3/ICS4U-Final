### C++ Basics: Comments, Variables, and Operators

#### Introduction to Programming and C++
C++ is a versatile programming language widely used in various fields, including game development, robotics, and systems programming.

#### Hello world
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This program outputs "Hello, World!" to the console. The `#include <iostream>` line is required to use `std::cout` for printing.

#### C++ Comments

**Types of Comments in C++:**
1. **Single-line comments:** Begin with `//`.
   ```cpp
   // This is a single-line comment
   ```
2. **Multi-line comments:** Begin with `/*` and end with `*/`.
   ```cpp
   /* This is a
      multi-line comment */
   ```

#### C++ Syntax and Structure
In C++, the syntax is quite different from python, which we are used to
- Every statement ends with a semicolon (`;`).
- Curly braces `{}` are used to define blocks of code (instead of indents).

Example of indentation and structure:
```cpp
if (true) {
    std::cout << "Condition is true." << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "Condition is false." << std::endl;
}
```
Proper indentation improves readability but is not required by the compiler.

#### Variables in C++
Variables store data that the program can use and manipulate.

**Declaring Variables:**
In C++, you must declare the data type of a variable when you create it.
```cpp
int age = 25;  // Declares an integer variable
```

**Basic Data Types:**
- `int`: Integer (whole numbers)
- `float`/`double`: Floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals)
- `char`: Single characters
- `bool`: Boolean values (`true` or `false`)
- `std::string`: Strings (requires `#include <string>`)

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    std::string name = "Bob";

    std::cout << "Hello, " << name << ". You are " << age << " years old." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Variable Rules:**
1. Names must begin with a letter or underscore (`_`).
2. Names cannot start with a number.
3. Names can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
4. Names are case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different).

#### Data Types in C++
C++ works with various data types to manage different kinds of information.

**Numeric Data Types:**
- `int`: For whole numbers.
- `float` and `double`: For decimal numbers.
  ```cpp
  int wholeNumber = 10;
  double decimalNumber = 3.14;
  ```

**Character and String Data Types:**
- `char`: Stores a single character.
- `std::string`: Stores a sequence of characters (text).
  ```cpp
  char grade = 'A';
  std::string message = "Hello, World!";
  ```

**Boolean Data Type:**
- `bool`: Represents `true` or `false` values.
  ```cpp
  bool isValid = true;
  ```

**Type Casting:**
You can convert one data type into another.
```cpp
int x = 10;
double y = static_cast<double>(x); // x is now a double
```

#### Arithmetic Operators in C++
Operators allow you to perform mathematical operations on variables.

**Arithmetic Operators:**
- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Modulus (remainder)

Example:
```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 3;
std::cout << "Addition: " << (a + b) << std::endl;
std::cout << "Modulus: " << (a % b) << std::endl;
```

**Comparison Operators:**
These compare two values and return a Boolean result.
- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to

Example:
```cpp
int x = 5, y = 10;
std::cout << (x < y) << std::endl;  // Outputs 1 (true)
```

#### Input in C++
C++ allows user input via the `std::cin` object.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int age;
    std::cout << "Enter your age: ";
    std::cin >> age;
    std::cout << "You entered: " << age << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Notes:**
- Use `std::cin` to get input from the user.
- Separate multiple inputs with spaces.
