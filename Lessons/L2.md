# Logical Operators & If Statements

---

## Expression
An **expression** in C++ is a combination of variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a value. For example:

```cpp
int x = 5;
int y = x + 3; // Expression x + 3 evaluates to 8
```

---

## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators in C++ are used to compare values and return `true` or `false`. Common comparison operators include:

- `==` equals
- `!=` not equals
- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `<=` less than or equal to

These conditions are used in structures like `if` statements and loops.

Example:

```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
if (b > a) {
    std::cout << "b is greater than a" << std::endl;
}
```

---

## If-Statements
In C++, an `if` statement is used to make decisions based on conditions.

### Syntax

```cpp
if (condition) {
    // Code block executed if condition is true
}
// Code here runs regardless of the condition
```

### Example:

```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
if (b > a) {
    std::cout << "b is greater than a" << std::endl;
}
std::cout << "This runs regardless of the condition." << std::endl;
```

---

## Else
The `else` block in C++ runs if the condition in the `if` statement is `false`.

### Example:

```cpp
int a = 20;
int b = 10;
if (b > a) {
    std::cout << "b is greater than a" << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "a is greater than or equal to b" << std::endl;
}
```

---

## Elif (Else If)
In C++, `else if` is used to check multiple conditions sequentially instead of `elif`.

### Example:

```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 10;
if (b > a) {
    std::cout << "b is greater than a" << std::endl;
} else if (a == b) {
    std::cout << "a and b are equal" << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "a is greater than b" << std::endl;
}
```

---

## Logical Operators
Logical operators in C++ are used to combine multiple conditions. These are different than we are used to in python, since for python we just use the words themselves.

- `&&` (and): Returns `true` if both conditions are true.
- `||` (or): Returns `true` if at least one condition is true.
- `!` (not): Reverses the boolean result.

### Examples:

#### And (`&&`):

```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int c = 30;
if (a < b && b < c) {
    std::cout << "Both conditions are true" << std::endl;
}
```

#### Or (`||`):

```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
if (a > b || b > 0) {
    std::cout << "At least one condition is true" << std::endl;
}
```

#### Not (`!`):

```cpp
int a = 10;
if (!(a > 0)) {
    std::cout << "Condition is false" << std::endl;
}
```

---

## Nested Ifs
C++ allows `if` statements to be nested inside other `if` statements.

### Example:

```cpp
int x = 15;
if (x > 10) {
    std::cout << "Above 10" << std::endl;
    if (x > 20) {
        std::cout << "Above 20" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "But not above 20" << std::endl;
    }
} else {
    std::cout << "10 or below" << std::endl;
}
