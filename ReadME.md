# Structure
The lessons folder contains all the created lessons, titled by the lesson number.
The worksheets folder contains 4 folders where all the worksheet answers are seperated by lesson. Every worksheet question has the question number in the file as a comment. 

Note: Variables only has 2 questions since I couldn't find a codeable third one

Note: Inputs Q3 is ridiculously more difficult in C++, I may attempt it later if I have time
